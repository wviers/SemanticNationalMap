***Getting data from the National Map***
The file format the conversion program accepts as input is a Personal GDB .mdb file.

These files can be downloaded from the National Map via the National Map Viewer
interface (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/).
    
    -Once in the Viewer, you can zoom the map to an extent you would like to download.
    
    
    -From here you can either click Download Data in the top right of the viewer and 
    download the current map extent or you can select a reference area in the download 
    options and then click one of the reference areas on the map.  This will display the 
    reference area in the panel on the left for you to click download.
    
    
    -After selecting your area to download, you can click any number of checkboxes to 
    determine which data you will receive and you will select the format 
    "Personal GDB 9.2" (If the Personal GDB 9.2 is not available you may need to zoom
    in and/or select a different reference area).

    
    -Finally, checkout the items you have selected and an email address you would like
    the data to be sent to.
    
    
***Using the Conversion Program***
The conversion program comes in the form of an executable jar file.  This means a 
Java Runtime Environment is required to run the program.
    
    -When the jar file is executed (in Windows this can be done by double clicking
    the nm2rdf.jar file, or in Linux by running java -jar nm2rdf.jar)  a title screen
    will appear and after continue is clicked a screen with a file selector will appear.  
   
   
    -Browse to the .mdb file you would like to convert and click Convert File.
   
   
    -A new window will appear displaying that the program is converting the data.
    When it is finished another window will appear saying whether or not the conversion
    was successful (This could take several minutes depending on the size of the input).
   
   
    -The output N3 files will be created in the directory the input file was retrieved 
    from.



***Known Issues***
If the conversion process is taking longer then 10 minutes or failing with an 
OutOfMemoryError exception, then you will need to run the program from command prompt
with the command java -jar -Xms1024m -Mxm1024m nm2rdf.jar to increase the heap size 
to 1G.
(1024m is an arbitrary increase and can be more or less depending on the size of the 
input).
